Parser for cfgmml format

It is aimed for parsing cfgmml files to be converted to a column based format.
It needs a default file "infiledef.txt" for output to be configured and standardized for multiple input files.
And will need a prewrite filler file "inprefill.txt" to make extra column on an MOC based on another MOC.
Then will read all files in in/ directory and output to out\ directory.
